# Budget
This application lets you make a budget for personal use, a small business or 
organisation. The aim is not to create a full-fledged accounting system, but 
rather a simple yet flexible budgeting and reporting tool.

With this application you can keep track of your budgeted and actual income 
and expenses, as well as your assets and debts. You can also track them over 
time and in different levels of granularity.
