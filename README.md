## Background
Accounting is one of my many hobbies. Others are finance and investing. For 
many years I have managed my budget in a Microsoft Excel file, but it has 
gotten quite unwieldly and despite Excel being a very good program, it has 
certain limitations.

There are many applications and web services providing budget functionality. 
However, most of the free and cheap ones are too simplistic for my needs. I 
have searched for something where I can have multiple layers of granularity 
when it comes to income and expenses, without it being a full-blown accounting 
software. So far I haven't found anything suitable.

## Purpose
The purpose of Budget is to give the user a feature-rich budget application 
that is easy to use and customise. The user should be able to both make the 
budget and to follow it up with actual numbers.

## Goal
The goal of Budget is to make a Java application that:

* lets the user make budgets for both balance and results (or just one of them 
to simplify)
* lets the user follow up their budgets with actual numbers
* define the budget posts with whichever granularity the user wants
* shows all numbers in whichever granularity the user chooses, so roll-ups and 
drill downs are possible

## Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders of Budget would be people who want a more extensive 
bugeting application that are commonly available for free or for a low cost.
